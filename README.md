## Nah, it's time to get serious.... (a little bit)

#### Who am I?

Matyas, Matyi or whatever you like to call me, I prefer this two tho. I was born and raised in Hungary and currently living there as well. Having two kiddos,
8yo daughter,3yo little boy and 7 (yeah, it's seven...) cats. 

_Discalaimer: do not attempt to have that many kitties, they are straight from the hell I tell you for sure._

#### What I do?

I'm working as a full stack engineer _(oh, how I hate this phrase)_ at the most awesome company [One Beyond](https://github.com/onebeyond) for several years now and planning to do so for even more.

#### What I really do?

Since when I was a youngster I love and learn web development. I'm specialised in ECMA Script (JS/TS) and developer tooling. Saying this, I'm leading and working with webdev teams at any scale. Also really interested in DevOps and Cloud Engineering. I spend my working hours createing awesomeness and my freetime is assigned to my family mostly. In the last couple of months I fell in love with Rust (the programming language...for clarity), so now I'm spending a considerable amount of time writing and learning lower level code.

#### What am I up to?

Anything which is interesting enough to keep me focused. Apart from my daily dose of code, I'd love to work with anyone on FOSS/pet projects. I really want to dive into trekking and mountaneiring. Also, I play the bass, so I'm also into making some noise.
